## Salt Hackday project

This is a project I wrote while studying at the </salt> bootcamp. 
The rules were, to write a fullstack web application in ONE day and see what we came up with.

I wrote a webscraping application using CDP Puppeteer, that scrapes profiles from Instagram and Twitter and displays the results in one place. I like automation and this was a place where I could display my skills.
